# EFSET Calibration System

This set of pages provides the calibration process for EFSET observers. We hope to provide observers with a simpler framework for observing calibrations, as well as providing centre managers tools and resources to track teacher progress and development.

This network of pages provides a calibration system in one location, rather than a distrubted program of forms, audio locations, and rubric/scoring guidelines. Though its principle use will be for pushing monthly calibrations to observers, the standards and rubric guides can naturally be used for general EFSET scoring too.

The network of pages contains:

#### Home page / Information

* Links to other pages
* General guidance

#### Rubric and associated scoring guides

* Rubric is displayed in full

#### Monthly calibration

* Alterable page link to renew for each new calibration
* Embeded audio responses corresponding to questions - accessible globally
* Embeded rubric
* Embeded submission form
* All necessary details will be displayed in one page

The system of individual notifications and reports will continue as normal, since the method of submitting scores will be via the original EFSET Microsoft form.
